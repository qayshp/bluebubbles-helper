# Find My Friends helper (macOS 15+)

This target injects into `com.apple.findmy` and reads the People data exposed by
`FindMyLocateObjCWrapper.framework`. It is the helper half of the newer-macOS
Find My Friends integration in BlueBubbles Server.

The implementation intentionally exports an allowlisted payload. It does not
send private-framework `description` or `debugDescription` strings over the
socket.

## Response contract

`refresh-findmy-friends` returns:

- `locations`: one deterministic record per identifiable friend, seeded from
  the current cache before live refreshes begin
- `partial`: whether either the friend-list request or an individual location
  refresh exceeded its deadline
- `friendListTimedOut`: whether the helper had to use the cached friend list
- `timedOutHandles`: stable identifiers whose live refresh did not finish
- `skippedFriends`: count of records that had no stable identifier

A friend with no current location remains in `locations` with null coordinates
and address fields. This keeps slow or offline friends from disappearing.

## Build

The committed server artifact must contain both `x86_64` and `arm64` slices:

```sh
./scripts/build-universal.sh
```

The output is `dist/BlueBubblesFindMyHelper.dylib`. The script builds each
architecture separately, combines them with `lipo`, verifies both slices, and
checks that the install name is `@rpath/BlueBubblesFindMyHelper.dylib`.

Building does not copy into `/Applications` or terminate Find My. Installation
and injection are owned by BlueBubbles Server.

The helper ignores unrelated Private API actions that are broadcast for legacy
helpers. Unknown Find My actions still return an explicit transaction error.

## Tests

The payload tests require Xcode and use only Foundation:

```sh
./Tests/run-tests.sh
```

They cover stable-handle selection, missing and live locations, allowlisted
fields, deterministic ordering, friend-list and per-handle timeouts, duplicate
and late callbacks, and response delivery across a server reconnect.
